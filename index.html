<h1>Our menu</h1>
<div id="chicken"><h2>Chicken</h2><p> Chicken is one of the most well paired poultry options because their will generally be a fair ratio of white or dark meat and just enough fat which adds a juicyness. The flavor is meaty but not at all too rich or overpowering as some other meats are. This poultry has flavors that seem so basic simple but a good type of simple and often if you happen to get at the marrow of a chicken bone then thats kinda where a stronger richness of the chicken is, and its quite interesting actually that certain parts which I wouldn't even consider as substantial have very nice meaty poultry flavor (the chicken skin, the wishbone if you are lucky, grissel, and even the gizzards). Chickens are fed various chicken feeds which may be corn grain or veggie based.</p></div>
<div id="beef"><h2>Beef</h2><p> A good cut of beef generally tastes buttery and savory. In the US it is frequently eaten in a ground form, which is a mix of cuts(different areas of the animal). Beef is usually served with other savory components, like bread, and more neutral flavors like lettuce, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Beef tastes like heaven. Usually eaten with anything. It's just good. Like mutton, but less chewy and less gamey. Slightly metallic, and if cooked well it should have a delicious seared crust. Imagine the taste of mushrooms mixed with chicken. That’s the closest description I can think of.</p></div>
<div id="sushi"><h2>Sushi</h2><p>Sushi generally has a tangy taste due to the vinegared rice. Apart from it, the second thing that gives sushi a distinct taste is the fish topping. Salmon, tuna, and eel have a very light flavor while octopus has a stronger flavor. I won’t really recommend eating an octopus-topped sushi for first-timers. Tropical fruits slices such as ripe mango and peach added to the sushi also give a subtle sweet and sour taste which balances the fishy taste. Lastly, the sweet soy sauce where the sushi is dipped gives a sweet yet salty finish to the sushi. Maki Rolls are a favorite of people of all ages- from kids to adults. Maki stuffed with crab meat are the best! I’m quite sure you’ve tried eating crab for once in your life so a maki roll wouldn’t be that intimidating as compared to raw fish. Maki also have relatively less nori used so it would be good for people who are apprehensive about eating seaweed.</p></div>
